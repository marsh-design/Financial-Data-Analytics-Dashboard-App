MERN Finance Dashboard Application

This project is a comprehensive Finance Dashboard application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), incorporating Machine Learning, TypeScript, and Material-UI (MUI). The application provides an interactive interface for managing and visualizing financial data, featuring functionalities such as data grids, charts, and a prediction model.

Features
	•	Dashboard Overview: Provides a summary of key financial metrics and visualizations.
	•	Data Management: Includes data grids for efficient data handling and manipulation.
	•	Charts and Graphs: Offers various charts to represent financial data trends.
	•	Machine Learning Predictions: Integrates a prediction model to forecast financial outcomes.
	•	Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used
	•	Frontend: React, TypeScript, Material-UI (MUI)
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
	•	Database: MongoDB
	•	Machine Learning: Integrated prediction model for financial forecasting

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Node.js (v14 or above)
	•	MongoDB
